      Create a new Git repository called "Croissant" with 3 pages, index.html,
      photo.html and contact.html. Add some text on the index and contact pages,
      add a photo on the photo.html page and publish it to Netlify. Each page
      should link to each other. Then, add some CSS, change the background color
      of the website and deploy it again to Netlify. Deploy your website
      multiple times if needed. Submit the Netlify URL of your project.
